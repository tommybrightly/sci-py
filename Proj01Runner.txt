The following is a Python class named mean that calculates the mean 
of a dataset.

The class has two methods:

    __init__(self, dataset): This is the constructor method. It is called 
    when an object of this class is created. It takes one parameter, 
    'dataset', which is the data that the mean will be calculated from. 
    It assigns this dataset to the instance variable self.dataset.

    calculate(self): This method calculates the mean of the dataset. 
    It takes no parameters, but it uses the dataset that was passed to 
    the constructor and stored in self.dataset. The result is the mean 
    of the dataset and returned.

This class is used in the driver script in the file named Proj01.py, 
where m = mean(random_dataset) creates an object of the class 
and m.calculate() calls the calculate method on the object, 
returning the mean of the dataset.
