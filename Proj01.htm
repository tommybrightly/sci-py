<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view in the orientation material for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>



<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code</h2>

<p>You will find a driver source code file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong> 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Python Version Requirements</h2>
<p>Python is somewhat version sensitive, particularly between version 2.x and 
version 3.x. Your project will be graded using Python version 3.6.2 or a later version.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="10">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><p>Proj01 Copyright 2023 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project requires that you demonstrate your knowledge 
of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>import directives</li>
	<li>mean</li>
	<li>median</li>
	<li>sample standard deviation</li>
	<li>population standard deviation</li>



</ul>

	  <p>Before going any further, you should make certain that you have read 
	  the prescribed material in the Ebook. You can identify that material by 
	  selecting <strong>Asg01</strong> in the Bb menu and then selecting <strong>MLO-1.1 Objectives, Read, and Do</strong>. 
	  If you don't understand something in that material, you should ask your 
	  instructor for clarification.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>The zip file from which you downloaded this file also contains a file 
		named <strong>Proj01.py</strong> and a file named <strong>Proj01Runner.txt</strong>. 
		Copy and rename that file 
		<strong>Proj01Runner.py</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Since this is your first assignment in this course, you should begin by 
	  making sure that you understand everything in this document. Then you 
	  should make sure that you understand all the code in the file named
	  <strong>Proj01.py</strong>. Then you should make sure that you 
	  understand all the code in the newly-created file named <strong>
	  Proj01Runner.py</strong>. If you don't understand something, ask your 
	  instructor for clarification. (You could also ask ChatGPT for an 
	  explanation if you choose to do so. Just remember that ChatGPT sometimes 
	  makes mistakes.)</p>
	  <p>Edit the new file named <strong>Proj01Runner.py</strong> putting your 
	  name in the space where indicated. Then insert code where indicated to compute the 
	  following values for an incoming dataset of arbitrary length and numeric content.</p>
<ul>
	<li>mean</li>
	<li>median</li>
	<li>sample standard deviation</li>
	<li>population standard deviation</li>



</ul>

	  <p>DO NOT modify the code in your copy of the file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong>. If 
	  you do, your program probably won't meet the assignment specifications 
	  when I test it with my copy of the file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Place the file named <strong>Proj01Runner.py</strong> in the same folder as the file named 
	  <strong>Proj01.py</strong> and 
	  execute the script in the in the file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong>.</p>
	  <p>Your code in the file named <strong>Proj01Runner.py</strong> must compute and return the mean, the median,
the sample standard deviation, and the population standard deviation of an 
	  incoming dataset without use
of the statistics functions named sum, mean, median, stdev, or pstdev. You are 
	  only allowed to import the math library and you must write the code to 
	  compute those values without the benefit of library functions designed for 
	  that purpose. </p>
	  <p>The code in <strong>Proj01.py</strong> expects you to enter two or more 
	  numeric command-line arguments when you execute the code. If you 
	  don't enter the command-line arguments, a default dataset is created and 
	  used in place of the command line arguments. The first sample shown below 
	  was created without entering the command-line arguments. The second sample 
	  was created by entering the command-line arguments shown when the program 
	  was run.</p>
	  <p>If all of your code is correct, the following output will be displayed 
	  on the command-line screen. </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>
Expect two or more numeric command-line arguments
Command-line arguments missing.
Will use default values instead.
Default dataset = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Print your name here.

mean okay 3.0

median okay 3

sample standard deviation okay 1.5811

population standard deviation okay 1.4142</pre>
</div>
	  <p>If some of your code is not correct, text 
	  similar to the following will be displayed on the command line screen. </p>
<div class="a">
<pre>
Expect two or more numeric command-line arguments
random_dataset [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
Print your name here.

mean okay 3.0

median okay 3

sample standard deviation okay 1.5811

OOPS: population standard deviation not okay
1.5 was calculated
1.4142 is correct</pre>
</div>
	  <p>This second example shows an error in the calculations of the population standard deviation. If you see 
	  an <strong>OOPS</strong> message, go back and correct your 
	  errors until you get 
	  <strong>okay</strong> for all four statistical measures.</p>
	  <p>Also if you get any runtime errors, you will need to fix your code that is 
	  causing them. </p>
	  <p>Be sure that your name appears in the certification as indicated.</p>
	  <p>The code that you&nbsp;write must not import any libraries other than
	  <strong>math</strong>.</p>
	  <p>The program must terminate and return control to the operating system 
	  when control reaches the end of the file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong>. 
	  In other words, infinite loops are not allowed.</p>
	  <p>Do not copy the code from the file named <strong>Proj01.py</strong> into your file named 
	  <strong>Proj01Runner.py</strong>.</p>
	  <p>The required output depends on the command-line arguments that are 
	  entered when the 
	  program is run. The default dataset or the dataset based on the command-line arguments is printed 
	  at the beginning. You can use that information to debug your code if 
	  needed. Your instructor will test your solution with a different dataset.</p>
	  <p>One good approach is to first calculate the required values with pencil, 
	  paper, and a calculator. Then convert those processes to code.</p>
	  <p>The values that you return will be compared with values 
	  produced by the statistics functions named mean, median, stdev, or pstdev 
	  and they must match.</p>
	  <p>Do not round or limit the number of decimal digits in the values that 
	  your code returns. </p>
	  <p><strong><em>If you have any questions about this assignment, be sure to 
	  ask for clarification. Don't end up with a bad grade because you didn't 
	  understand the requirements.</em></strong></p>
